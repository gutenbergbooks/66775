<p>Unable to contain himself longer, although he
realized the vast futility of it all, Massington
seized her in his arms and buried her lovely eyes
and hair in the storm of a thousand kisses.</p>

<p>“You love me, Lolo&mdash;tell me you love me!” he
choked.</p>

<p>“No! no!” she cried, struggling from his clasp
with an adorable coquetry. “No, it must not be.”</p>

<p>Massington, for the moment, found himself unable
to speak. Then, “Why?” he asked simply,
softly.</p>

<p>“Because,” the girl replied, with a cunning
<i>moué</i>&mdash;“because</p>

<p>I don’t yet know my own mind,” she finished.</p>

<p>Massington moved toward her. The amber
glow of a small table lamp lighted up the bronze
glory of Lolo’s tumbled tresses. And her eyes
were as twin Chopin nocturnes dreaming out the
melody of a far-off, unattainable love.</p>

<p>He paused before daring to lift his voice against
the wonderful silence that, like midnight on southern
Pacific seas, hung over her.</p>

<p>Presently, “When you do decide, what then?”
he ventured.</p>

<p>“When I do decide,” she told him, “it will be
forever. But ere I give you my answer, ere we
take the step that must mean so much in our
lives, we must both be strong enough to remember
that</p>

<p>Society demands certain conventions that dare not
be intruded upon.” Lolo toyed with some roses
on the table at her side&mdash;roses he had sent her that
same afternoon.</p>

<p>“But, darling,” breathed Massington, “what are
mere conventions for us two now?”</p>

<p>Lolo tore at one of the roses with her teeth.
“Oh!” she exclaimed, flinging out her arm wildly
toward the ugly green wall-paper of her room that
symbolized everything she so hated&mdash;“Oh, I know&mdash;I
know! I do not want to think of them, but I&mdash;but
we&mdash;must, Jason sweetheart, we must! And
life so all-wondrous, beating vainly against their

iron bars and looking beyond them into paradise.
We <i>must</i> think of them,”&mdash;a little sob crept from
her throat,&mdash;“we <i>must</i> think of them!”</p>

<p>“Let us think, rather,” said Massington, “of that
other world in which we might live, to which, Lolo
dear, we might go, and, once there, be away from
every one, all alone, we two&mdash;just you and I. Let
us think of Spain, shimmering like some great
topaz under the tropic sun; of the Pyrenees that,
purpled against the evening heavens, watch over
the peaceful valleys of Santo Dalmerigo; of the
drowsy noons and silver moons of Italy; let us

<p>PLACE: A small country town in New York State.</p>

<p>TIME: The present day.</p>

<p><i>When the curtain rises, the stage is in complete
darkness. Mary enters, goes to centre table and
turns up small oil lamp. Immediately the whole
stage is lighted with a dazzling brilliance. Mary
catches sight of Dalton standing in doorway L.U.E.
A sinister smile is on his lips, a riding crop in his
hand.</i></p>

<p class="stagedir">(<i>in tears</i>)</p>

<p>Oh, how can you, how can you? Was it not
enough that you stole my youth, that you made me
what I am?</p>

<p class="center">DALTON</p>

<p>So, my proud beauty, your spirit is broken at last!
And at last I have you within my power!</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>Oh, God, give me strength! If I were a man, I’d
<i>kill</i> you! You are of the kind who drag women
to the gutter.</p>

<p class="center">DALTON</p>

<p>Now, now, my fine young animal! Remember&mdash;’twas
you, too, who sinned!</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p class="stagedir">(<i>sobbing wildly</i>)</p>

<p>Folly, yes&mdash;but not sin, no, no&mdash;not sin, not sin!
It is the weakness of women and the perfidy of
men that makes women sin.</p>

<p class="center">DALTON</p>

<p class="stagedir">(<i>sneering</i>)</p>

<p>Sin it was&mdash;<i>sin</i>, I repeat it. You&mdash;you’re no better
now than the women of the streets!</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>No, no! Don’t say that, don’t say that! Have
pity!</p>

<p class="stagedir">(<i>throwing herself before him</i>)</p>

<p class="stagedir">(<i>pleading</i>)</p>

<p>Who asks you to give back what is more precious
to her than jewels and riches, than life itself&mdash;her
honor!</p>

<p class="center">DALTON</p>

<p>Enough of that! Now, you, listen to me! Do as
I say and I can make a lady of you&mdash;you shall be
dressed like a queen and move in society, loved,
honored and famous. This I offer you if&mdash;if you
will become my wife.</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>Your wife! Not if all the gold of the world were
in your hands, and you gave it to me. Your wife&mdash;never&mdash;never&mdash;not
even to become a lady! Before
I’d be your wife I’d live in rags and be proud
of my poverty! There is the door&mdash;<i>go</i>!</p>

<p class="center">DALTON</p>

<p>Not so fast, my girl!</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p class="center">DALTON</p>
<p class="stagedir">(<i>in a superior tone, loftily ignoring the insult</i>)</p>

<p>Hm, you Americans are a peculiar lot. But I suppose
your manners will improve as your country
grows older.</p>

<p class="center">DICK</p>

<p>Oh, I see! So you’re an Englishman, aren’t you?
Englishmen never believe how fast we grow in this
country. They won’t believe that George Washington
ever made them get out of it, either, but he
did!</p>

<p class="center">DALTON</p>

<p>Ah, my dear fellow, <i>our</i> country has grown up of
its own accord, but <i>you</i> have to get immigrants to
help <i>you</i> build up <i>your</i> country&mdash;and what are
they?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p class="center">DICK</p>

<p>That’s so: they don’t amount to anything until they
come over here and inhale the free and fresh air
of liberty. Then they become <i>American citizens</i>
and they amount to a great deal. We build up the
West and feed the world!</p>

<p class="center">DALTON</p>

<p>Feed the world! Oh, no! Certainly you don’t feed
England!</p>

<p class="center">DICK</p>

<p>Oh yes we do! We’ve fed England. We gave you
a warm breakfast in 1776, a boiling dinner in
1812&mdash;and we’ve got a red-hot supper for you any
time you want it!</p>

<p>Have courage, sweetheart; do not cry. Everything
will turn out for the best in the end.</p>

<p class="center">MARY</p>

<p>You have the courage for both of us. Every blow
that has fallen, every door that has been shut between
me and an honest livelihood, every time that
clean hands have been drawn away from mine and
respectable faces turned aside as I came near them,
I’ve come to you for comfort and love and hope&mdash;and
have found them.</p>

<p class="center">DICK</p>

How you’ve suffered in silence! But brighter days
are before us.</p>

<p>The snow swirled against the window in great
gusts. Agatha Brewster sat looking into the flaming
grate.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, mamma dear?” asked
Betty, her little daughter. “You look so sad&mdash;<i>and
this is Christmas eve</i>.”</p>

<p>Agatha did not answer. She could not trust her
voice. There was a mist before her eyes. She
sat there thinking, thinking, thinking. It was just
a year ago tonight that Dave, her husband, had
parted from her in anger. Since then no word, no
letter&mdash;nothing but endless conferences with that
hideous lawyer, the unbearable condolences of
well-meaning friends, the dull heart-ache, the
thought of little Betty....

<p>Betty crept noiselessly down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Papa! Oh, papa! My papa!” she cried.
“You’ve come home again. Won’t Santa Claus be
glad!”</p>

<p>Brewster, his eyes suddenly blinded with tears,
grabbed the sweet child to his breast and hugged
her, oh, so close! And then, bending down, he
kissed the brave little woman at his side.</p>

<p class="hanging4">FOREWORD: <i>A season or so ago, Mr. Cyril
Maude and Miss Laurette Taylor attracted
considerable attention in a one-word play&mdash;a
play in one act, each line of whose dialogue
consisted of a single word. In order
to meet the insistent public demand for constantly
increased novelty, I submit herewith
what is probably the dernier cri in dramatic
literature&mdash;a play in one letter.</i></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Broadway playwright&mdash;one who possesses the
ability to compress the most interesting episodes in
several characters’ lifetimes into two uninteresting
hours.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The art of emotional acting, on Broadway, consists
in expressing (1) <i>doubt</i> or <i>puzzlement</i>, by
scratching the head; (2) <i>surprise</i>, by taking a sudden
step backwards; (3) <i>grief</i>, by turning the
back to audience and bowing head; (4) <i>determination</i>
(if standing), by thrusting handkerchief back
into breast pocket, brushing hair back from fore-head
with a quick sweep of hand and buttoning
lower button of sack coat; (5) <i>determination</i> (if
seated), by looking fixedly at audience for a moment
and then suddenly standing up; (6) <i>despair</i>,
by rumpling hair, sinking upon sofa, reaching over
to table, pouring out stiff drink of whiskey and
swallowing it at one gulp; (7) <i>impatience</i>, by
walking quickly up stage, then down, taking cigarette
from case, lighting it and throwing it immediately
into grate, walking back up stage again and
then down; (8) <i>relief</i>, by taking deep breath, exhaling
quickly and mopping off face with handkerchief;
and (9) <i>fear</i>, by having smeared face
with talcum powder!</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The leading elements in the Broadway humour,
in the order of their popularity: (1) speculation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
as to how the Venus de Milo lost her arms, and
(2) what she was doing with them when she lost
them.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Broadway actors may in the main be divided into
two groups; those who pronounce it burgular and
those whom one cannot hear anyway back of the
second row.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="center"><i>The Syllogism of the Broadway Drama</i></p>

<p>1. Someone loves someone.</p>

<p>2. Someone interposes.</p>

<p>3. Someone is outwitted, someone marries someone,
and someone gets two dollars.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Such critics as contend that literature is one
thing and drama another, are apparently of the
notion that literature is something that consists
mainly of long words and allusions to Châteaubriand,
and drama something that consists mainly
of monosyllables and allusions to William J. Burns.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The test supreme of all acting is the coincidental
presence upon the stage of a less competent actress
who is twice as good-looking.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>A Thumb-nail Critique&mdash;The plays which, in the
last two decades, have in the United States made
the most money: “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” “Way
Down East,” “The Old Homestead,” “Ben Hur,”
and “Peg o’ My Heart.” The plays which, in the
last two decades, have, in the United States, made
the least money: “The Thunderbolt,” “Strife,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
“The Three Daughters of M. Dupont,” “The Incubus,”
and “General John Regan.”</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>The unities of the Belasco drama: Time, place
and (legal) action.</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>Constructive critic: One who builds up the newspaper’s
theatrical advertising revenue.</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>The producers of our two-dollar music shows are
rapidly gobbling up all the vaudeville actors. This
will immeasurably help vaudeville.</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>The circuses will soon go into winter quarters.
They cannot compete with the Drama Leagues.</p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>The world may be divided thus: actors and
dramatic critics. The only difference between
them is that the former do their acting on a platform.</p>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Shakespeare’s plays fall into two distinct groups:
Those written by Shakespeare and those acted by
Beerbohm Tree.</p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>Dramatic criticism: The theory that one is more
interested in the devices with which a woman makes
herself beautiful&mdash;cold creams, mascaro, false hair,
eyebrow pencils, lip rouge, face powder, dental
floss, whale-bone, curl papers, et cetera&mdash;than in
the beautiful woman herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Something seemingly never remembered by dramatists
when writing love scenes: the more a
young woman really loves a man the less talkative,
the more silent, she is in his presence....
Only women over thirty are chatty before the
object of their affection.</p>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>The proficient actor is one who can completely
immerse his own personality in the rôle he is playing.
The star actor is one who can completely
immerse the rôle he is playing in his own personality.</p>

<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>Although it may have absolutely nothing to do
with the case, I yet believe that, in a romantic
stage rôle, no actress can possibly be convincing
or persuasive if she is able in private life to eat
tripe, chicken livers, calves’ brains or a thick steak.</p>

<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>Maurice Donnay, the talented gentleman of Gallic
dramatic letters, observes, “The French dramatists
treat of love because it is the only subject
which every member of the audience understands,
and a dramatist must, of course, appeal to the
masses.” Which, in another way, may account for
the great appeal and success in America of crook
plays.</p>

<h3>XX</h3>

<p>When a critic refers to a male actor’s “authority,”
the betting odds are generally thirty to one
that what he has done is to mistake for that quality
the aforesaid actor’s <i>embonpoint</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<h3>XXI</h3>

<p>Mr. George P. Goodale, a good citizen and an
honest taxpayer, was lately accorded a great banquet
in honor of his fifty years of continuous service
as dramatic critic to the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>.
At the banquet, it was said, repeated, and emphasized
that, in all his half-century as a critic of the
drama, Mr. Goodale had never made a single
enemy. Where, than in this banquet and its import,
a smarter satire on the American notion of
what constitutes dramatic criticism?</p>

<h3>XXII</h3>

<p>The hero of a Broadway play may not be bald.
This would seem, in the Broadway drama, to be
the first rule of heroism and, with heroism, of intelligence
and appeal. So, Julius Caesar, Bismarck,
George Washington, Napoleon and Shakespeare
would be low villains.</p>

<h3>XXIII</h3>

<p>It is a favourite challenge of the average Broadway
playwright to the dramatic critic that if the
latter knows so much about plays, why doesn’t he
write one himself. The same question might be
asked of the average Broadway playwright.</p>

<h3>XXIV</h3>

<p>The financial success of the Broadway play is
conditioned on the proportion of theatergoers who
believe that singeing keeps the hair from falling
out and that the American Indians were accustomed
to use the word “heap” before every adjective.
The last season was the most successful
Broadway has known in years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<h3>XXV</h3>

<p>It took Molière and Sheridan, as it now takes
Shaw and Bahr, years to fashion their comedies.
And yet, when all is said and done, what is funnier,
what provokes a louder laughter, than the
mere articulation of the name Gustav?</p>

<h3>XXVI</h3>

<p>Literature is an art wherein one observes the
effects of the thematic action upon the protagonist’s
mind. Drama is an art wherein one observes
the effects of the thematic action upon the protagonist’s
heart. Burlesque is an art wherein one
observes the effects of the thematic action upon
the protagonist’s trousers-seat.</p>

<h3>XXVII</h3>

<p>“Trying it on the dog”&mdash;a phrase referring to
the trying out of a play in the provinces before
bringing it into the metropolis. In other words,
testing the effect of the play upon an intelligent
community to predetermine, by its lack of success
there, its subsequent prosperity in New York.</p>

<h3>XXVIII</h3>

<p>The so-called “laughs” in an American musical
show must, if they would “get over,” be devised
in such a manner and constructed of such basic materials
that they shall be within the scope of the
intelligence of persons who can neither read nor
write. This is why nine-tenths of the persons in
a Broadway audience fall out of their chairs with
mirth when anybody on the stage refers to whiskers
as alfalfa or when a character is named the
Duc de Gorgonzola.</p>

<h3>XXIX</h3>

<p>Royalties.&mdash;The percentage of the gross receipts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
which playwrights get from producers, after lawsuits.</p>

<h3>XXX</h3>

<p>The critic who believes that such a thing as a
repertory company is artistically possible believes
that a dozen modern actors, assembled into one
group, are sufficiently talented and skilled to interpret
satisfactorily a dozen plays. The critic
who does not believe that such a thing as a repertory
company is artistically possible knows that a
dozen modern actors, assembled into one group,
are insufficiently talented and skilled to interpret
satisfactorily even one play.</p>

<h3>XXXI</h3>

<p>It is the custom in many New York theaters to
ring a bell in the lobby so as to warn the persons
congregated there that the curtain is about to go
up on the next act and that it is time for them to
go back into the theater. But it still remains for
an enterprising impresario to make a fortune by
ringing a bell in the theater so as to warn the persons
congregated there that the curtain is about
to go up on the next act and that it is time for
them to go back into the lobby!</p>

<h3>XXXII</h3>

<p>Farces fall into two classes: Those in which the
leading male character implores “Let me explain!”
and the leading female character tartly replies,
“That’s the best thing you do,” and those in which
the leading male character’s evening dress socks
have white clocks on them.</p>

<h3>XXXIII</h3>

<p>Mr. Florenz Ziegfeld succeeds with his shows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
because he addresses his chief appeal to the eye.
Mr. George M. Cohan succeeds with his because he
addresses his chief appeal to the ear. The impresarios
of the Fourteenth Street burlesque shows
succeed with theirs because they address their chief
appeal to the nose.</p>

<h3>XXXIV</h3>

<p>The one big ambition of nine out of every ten
American playwrights is, in the argot of the theater,
to “get over the footlights.” The one big
ambition of nine out of every ten audiences is exactly
the same!</p>

<h3>XXXV</h3>

<p>Most so-called optimistic comedies are based on
the theory that a cup of coffee improves in proportion
to the number of lumps of sugar one puts
into it.</p>

<h3>XXXVI</h3>

<p>Opening Night.&mdash;The night before the play is
ready to open.</p>

<h3>XXXVII</h3>

<p>The chief dramatic situation in “The Road to
Happiness” consists of a hero who, with hand on
hip pocket, defies the assembled villains to advance
as much as an inch at peril of their lives and who,
having thus held them at bay, proceeds to pull
out a handkerchief, flick his nostril and make his
getaway. The chief comic situation in “Arizona,”
produced many years ago, consisted of the same
thing, save that a whiskey flask or plug of tobacco&mdash;I
forget which&mdash;was used in place of a nose-doily.
Thus, little boys and girls, has our serious
drama advanced.</p>

<p><i>Manager.</i>&mdash;From the Anglo-Saxon word “manger,”
the “a” having been deleted in order that
the word might be shortened, and so used more
aptly for purposes of swearing. <i>Manager</i> thus
comes from “manger,” something which provides
fodder for the jackasses in the stalls.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, it is reasonable to believe
that the public doesn’t want gloom in the theater
not because it is gloom, not because of the gloom
itself, but for the very good reason that gloom
isn’t generally interesting. Let a playwright make
gloom as interesting as happiness and the public
will want it theatrically. But the gloom of the
drama is, more often than not, uninteresting gloom.
In illustration: Take two street-corner orators.
Suppose both are talking, one a block away from
the other, on precisely the same topic. It is a
gloom topic. For instance, the question of the
large number of starving unemployed. One of
the orators hammers away at his audience with
melancholy statistics and all the other depressing
elements of his subject. The other, equally serious,
makes his points, not alone as does the first
orator with blue figures, but with light comparisons
and saucy illustrations. Which is the more
interesting? Which gets the larger crowd? Which
convinces? Take a second and correlated illustration.

Two weekly magazines print articles on,
let us say, the work of organized charity in its
attempt to relieve the community’s paupers. In
itself, not particularly jocose reading matter. One
of the two magazines, in its treatment of the story,
has its general tone exampled by some such sentence
as “Last month the charity organizations of
New York supplied the poor of the city with
30,000 loaves of bread.” The other magazine, expressing
the same thought and facts, has its sentence
phrased thus: “Last month the charity organizations
of New York supplied the poor of
the city with 30,000 loaves of bread, an amount
almost 8,000 in excess of all the bread eaten during
the same space of time by Mr. Diamond Jim
Brady in the ten leading Broadway restaurants.”
Which magazine has the bigger circulation?</p>

<p>The conventional treatment of gloomy themes in
the drama is like the ancient tale of the proud
old coon who, driving a snail-paced and ramshackle
horse and an even more ramshackle buggy down a
Southern road used largely by automobilists, suddenly
perceived a small boy hitching on behind.
“Hey!” exclaimed the old brunette, “Yoh look out
dar! Ef yoh ain’t careful yoh’ll be sucked under!”
The mechanic of the gloomy dramatic theme, like
the old dinge, too often takes his theme too pompously,
too seriously. And is generally himself
sucked under as a result. Clyde Fitch took a
so-called gloomy theme in his play “The Climbers”&mdash;the
play that started bang off with a funeral&mdash;but
his play is still going with the public in the
stock companies because he didn’t let the gloom
of his story run away with the interest. The final
curtain line in “The Shadow” is: “After all, real
happiness is often to be found in tears.” Tears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
are often provocative of a greater so-called “up-lift”
feeling than mere grins and laughter. Take a
couple or more of illustrations of the most popular
mob plays America has known, say, “Way Down
East,” “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” “The Old Homestead.”
These, fundamentally, are what the mob
calls “sad” plays. The yokelry would ever rather
pay for the privilege of crying than laughing.
What farce ever made as much money as “East
Lynne”? The tears in “Cinderella” have made it
the world’s most successful theatrical property.</p>

there, she seemed for all the world like some
breathing, living young goddess come down to earth
in a chariot of cloud chiffon tinted orange-pink by
the setting sun. Her slender body whispered its
allure from out the thin folds of silk that, like
some fugitive mist, clung about her. Her hair, a
tangle of spun copper, fell upon her dimpled
shoulders and tumbled off them, a stormy bronze
cascade, to the ground. Her eyes, like twin melodies
of Saint-Saens imbedded in Bermuda’s blue
woodland pools; her voice, soft as the haunt of a
distant guitar&mdash;&mdash;.”</p>

<h3>THE HEROINE</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>From the newspaper critique of the play made

<p>“The role of Faith Draycourt was ably interpreted
by that accomplished and experienced
actress, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, who is well remembered by the
older generation of theater-goers for her fine performance
of <i>Juliet</i> in 1876 at the old Bowery
Theater.”</p>

<p>An arm-chair beside a reading lamp is the only
place for worth-while drama. If you are one of
those who seriously contends that such drama
should be acted in the theater, that the stage is the
place for such work, that it stands a fair chance
there, tell me what you think would happen to
Hauptmann’s “Weavers” if, in that wonderful climax
to the fifth act, the child actress playing
Mielchen should accidentally drop her panties, or
to “Hannele” if, at a moment of its poignant
pathos, a shirt-sleeved Irish scene-shifter were
plainly observable in the wings.... Think of
Sudermann’s “Princess Far-Away” with a bad cold
in her head and an obviously tender corn!</p>

<p>We hear much of the difference twixt the quality

<p>You say it is possible for drama to reflect life?
Very well, then answer me this. In the cabled dispatches
from the European fighting countries,
there appeared the other day an account of the
astounding spectacular heroism, in the face of a
death-filled fire, of a German soldier named Ludwig
Dinkelblatz. If you can reconcile yourself to

<p>Mr. Edward Locke, who wrote “The Bubble,”
“The Revolt,” and other reasons for bad theatrical
seasons, observed in a recent interview that he
always writes his plays by artificial light because
plays are always produced by artificial light, and
that, therefore, he believed that this was the logical
way to go about writing plays. Mr. Locke
will agree with his critics that inasmuch as people
always go to bed in the dark, it is but logical that,
when the lights go out in the auditorium and one
of his plays gets under way, they should go to
sleep.</p>

<p>We hear a great deal of the American drama’s
failure to hold the mirror up to nature. This is
nonsense, nothing more nor less. The trouble is not
with the drama, but with the mirror! The American
drama tries to reflect nature in one of the
little mirrors women carry in their vanity-boxes.
Some day it may learn&mdash;as the French drama has
learned&mdash;that when there’s any reflecting of nature
to be done, you’ve got to use a pier glass. We
like to believe, we Anglo-Saxons, that all drama
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
lies in mortals’ faces, and that drama’s purpose is
merely to reflect, as in a shaving mirror, men’s
tears and smiles. The French, a wiser people,
know that drama reposes alone in men’s bodies.</p>

<p>NOTE.&mdash;<i>In Bernard Shaw’s “Fanny’s First
Play,” there are introduced in an epilogue four
characters representing as many dramatic critics
of London&mdash;A. B. Walkley, Gilbert Cannan, etc.
These four critics are made by Shaw to discuss the
play in their four typical and familiar critical
ways. When the play was produced in America it
was suggested to Shaw that he come to the United
States, study the peculiarities of the local critics,
and alter his epilogue so that the indelible attitudes
toward everything dramatic of the native
criticerei might be lampooned for American audiences.
Shaw was too busy. Being possessed of an
hour’s spare time and considerable presumption,
the present writer essays the task in Shaw’s behalf.

written play.</i></p>

<p class="center">FENEMY</p>

<p>You ask me if I like the play. How do I know!
If it’s by a foreigner, sure I like it; but if it’s by
an American (particularly a <i>young</i> American) you
can bet I’ll roast it. Why, it’s got to the point
where some of these young American playwrights
are getting to be better known than we are, and
I’ll be darned if I’m going to do anything to help
the thing along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p class="center">HILL</p>

<p>You’re right, Fenemy. Besides, they know how
to do these things so much better abroad than our
writers do. Take this play. Pretty good, to be
sure. But I’ll wager it was written by some fellow
who used to be a reporter&mdash;probably on my
very paper. And <i>I’m</i> not going to be the one to
give him the swelled head. No, sir!</p>

<p class="center">DIXON</p>

<p>If Belasco had only produced this play it would
have been a wonder. Belasco’s a wizard. I
know it, because he has repeatedly told me so himself.</p>

<p class="center">SUMMERS</p>

<p>Ah, gentlemen&mdash;gentlemen. Why indulge in this
endless colloquy over this insignificant proscenium
tidbit. Let us remember that howsoever good it
may be it was still not written by Shakespeare and
that however ably it may have been interpreted,
Booth and Barrett and Charlotte Cushman, alas,
are no longer with us.</p>

<p class="center">HILL</p>

<p>Oh, you’re a back-number, Summers. You’re no
critic&mdash;you’re a scholar! Why don’t you put a
punch in your stuff and get a good job?</p>

<p class="center">FENEMY</p>

<p>I wonder if it’s possible this play’s meant to be
satirical. I’ll read what you say about it in the
morning, Hill, and if you think it’s a satire, I’ll
see it again and sort o’ edit my opinion of it in
the Sunday edition.</p>

<p class="center">DIXON</p>

<p>I must say again that I’m sorry Belasco didn’t
produce the play. He’s a genius. Look what he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
did for <i>The Easiest Way</i>. If it hadn’t been for
his lighting effects the show wouldn’t have stood
a chance!</p>

<p class="center">FENEMY</p>

<p>You’re right, Dixon. Anyway, <i>The Easiest Way</i>
was just like <i>Iris</i>. Our writers can’t touch the
English. Besides, Pinero’s got a title and Eugene
Walter, we must remember, once slept on a bench
in Bryant Park.</p>

<p class="center">HILL</p>

<p>I like the title of this piece though, fellows.
<i>Fanny’s Second Play</i>. It’ll give me the chance to
say in my review of it: “<i>Fanny’s Second Play</i>
won’t go for a minute.” Catch it? Second&mdash;minute.
Great, isn’t it? I like plays with titles you
can crack jokes about.</p>

<p class="center">SUMMERS</p>

<p>Alack-a-day, things are not in criticism as they
used to be. Dignity, my friends, is what I always
aimed for&mdash;dignity and dullness. Poor Daly is
dead and poor Wallack sleeps in his grave.
Schoolboys, mere schoolboys and shopkeepers run
the drama of to-day.</p>

<p class="center">HILL</p>

<p>Oh, cut it out. Dan Daly wasn’t half as good a
comedian as Eddie Foy is! And Shakespeare&mdash;why
the only time that any interest in Shakespeare
has been aroused in the last ten years was when
Julia Marlowe and Sothern got married. Give
me Sutro.</p>

<p class="center">DIXON</p>

<p>But as I was saying, Belasco’s the man! Shakespeare
in his palmiest moments never imagined a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
greater effect than that soft lamp-light that Belasco
put over the chess table in the last act of
<i>The Concert</i>.</p>

<p class="center">FENEMY</p>

<p>Correct again, Dixon! Do you think Belasco
would use German silver knives and forks on a
dinner table in a play of his? Nix! The real
stuff for him! <i>Sterling!</i> And you can say what
you want, it’s attention to details like that that
makes a play. I suppose <i>Fanny’s Second Play</i>
may be pretty good drama, but I never had any
experience like the hero in the show and by
George, I don’t believe it could have happened!
Besides, <i>my</i> sister never acted that way and consequently
I must put the whole thing down as rubbish.
The author doesn’t understand human nature.
No, sir, he doesn’t understand human
nature!</p>

<p class="center">HILL</p>

<p>The society atmosphere, too, is perfectly ridiculous.
Why, I’ve been in the Astor as many as five
times and I never saw any society people act that
way. Our American playwrights are not gentlemen,
that’s the rub.</p>

<p class="center">SUMMERS</p>

<p>Ah me, when Sarah Siddons and Clara Morris
and Ada Rehan were in their prime&mdash;those were
the days! What use longer, I ask you, gentlemen,
to inscribe praise to actresses if one is no more
invited to meals by them? Times have changed.
This Mr. Cohan, paugh! This Miss Barrymore,
fie!!</p>

<p class="center">DIXON</p>

<p>Sure thing! Warfield’s the only one left who can
act and <i>Belasco</i> taught <i>him</i> all <i>he</i> knows.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
Belasco&mdash;there’s the wizard! Did you notice the way he
got that amber light effect in <i>Seven Chances</i>?

<p class="h3sub">A Glossary of British Slang</p>

<p>When George Ade’s “College Widow” was produced
in London several years ago, a section of the
program was devoted to a glossary of American
slang. The British equivalents for the various
specimens of Yankee vernacular were thus provided,
so that the audience might comprehend the
meaning of the words spoken by the characters in
the play. By way of helping American audiences
to a better understanding of the British vulgate,
I append a reciprocating glossary:</p>

<p><i>Actor</i>&mdash;A war-time patriot who shouts “God
Save the King” as he hurries aboard the first
steamer out of Southampton to accept an engagement
in an American musical comedy adapted from
the German.</p>

<p><i>Beastly</i>&mdash;A condemnatory adjective applied by
an actor (see above) to the treatment accorded an
actor (see above) by Americans during his engagement
in an American musical comedy adapted from
the German, after the actor (see above) has returned
to England following a declaration of
peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p><i>Handkerchief</i>&mdash;A small square of linen with
which, when he has (or hasn’t) a cold, an Englishman
blows his wrist.</p>

<p><i>Old Top</i>&mdash;A term of endearment applied by an
actor (see above) to an American who seems to be
about to buy a drink.</p>

<h3>THE STORY</h3>

<h4>Act I</h4>

<p>At Tonio’s signal, the curtains open disclosing a
cross-roads with a rude portable theatre and Mrs.
Cornelius Vanderbilt with a party of débutantes.
The distant sounds of a cracked trumpet and belabored
drum call the peasants together, and they
greet with joy the familiar characters in whose
costumes Canio, Nedda, and Beppo enter simultaneously
with Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont’s party,
Mrs. Otto Kahn’s party, Mrs. Goelet, in mauve
<i>faille d’amour</i> silk, and a party of young people
chaperoned by Mrs. Douglas Robinson. Silencing
the crowd (on the stage), Canio announces the
play for the evening&mdash;and is heard. Canio descends
and boxes the ears of Tonio, who loves
Nedda. Tonio, and two old gentlemen of decided
snoring proclivities who have been sitting in the
eighth row, wander off. A villager invites the
players to drink. Twenty-seven gentlemen in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
audience accept the invitation. The villager hints
that Tonio lingers to flirt with Nedda, and the
ladies in the boxes also get busy with recent scandal.
Canio takes it as a joke, twenty-one of the
twenty-seven gentlemen taking it with water.
Canio says he loves his wife. And, after kissing
her, he departs coincident with the arrival of the
occupants of the Gould and Sloane boxes. The
other peasants, and forty-two other gentlemen,
leave the scene.</p>

<p>Nedda, left alone, broods over the fierce look
which Canio and Gatti Casazza gave her. She
wonders if Canio suspects her. The sunlight and
the new gown and necklace on Mrs. Payne Whitney
thrill her and she revels in the song and the
sport of the birds (“Ballatella”). At the end of
the rhapsody she finds that the hideous Tonio, if
not the audience, has been listening. He makes
ardent love, but she laughs him to scorn. He
pursues her, however, and she, picking up Beppo’s
whip, slashes him across the face. He swears revenge
and stumbles away. Now her secret lover,
Silvio, steals in with the twenty-seven gentlemen
who have been over to Browne’s. Silvio pleads
with her to go away with him. She promises in
an undertone to meet him that night at Del Pezzo’s
Italian Restaurant at the corner of Seventh Avenue
and Thirty-fourth Street. Tonio, having seen
them, hurries away. He gets the ear of Canio and
returns coincidently with thirty-four of some
forty-odd gentlemen who have been across the
street. Silvio, however, escapes unnoticed and so
do the two old gentlemen who have been sleeping
in the eighth row.</p>

<p>Canio threatens to kill Nedda and Leoncavallo’s
music. Beppo and one of the old gentlemen who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
has forgotten his overcoat rush back. Beppo disarms
Canio. Tonio hints that Nedda’s lover may
appear that night in the play and some bizarre
looking ladies in the third row hint a lot of other
things. Left alone, Canio bewails his bitter fate,
and the gentlemen whose wives won’t let them get
out do the same. In wild grief, Canio finally
gropes his way off. And such gentlemen as are
left in the audience follow suit.</p>

MONEY</h2>
</div>

<p>The box-office price of a theatre ticket is two
dollars. The average play runs from 8.25 until
10.55&mdash;in other words, about two hours and a half.
A total, that is, of one hundred and fifty minutes.
The intermissions between the acts amount, at a
rough estimate, to a total of about thirty-five
minutes. Subtract the thirty-five minutes from the
one hundred and fifty minutes, and we have left
one hundred and fifteen minutes. You pay, therefore,
two dollars for one hundred and fifteen minutes
of entertainment, or about one and three-quarters
cents a minute. Let us now see what you
get for your money, and also the equivalent of
what you could get for it did you spend it in other
directions. A few illustrations may suffice to make
one pause and reflect:</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
